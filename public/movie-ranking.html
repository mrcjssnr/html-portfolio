<h1>The Best Movies According to Marco</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies/anime/series of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Doctor Stranger</h3>
<p>I kinda like this kdrama from the first episode until the end. <br>
I highly recommend this to those who also love medical dramas a lot.</p>
<h3>Naruto Shippuden</h3>
<p>This is my favorite anime as I love ninjas when I was a child.</p>
<h3>The Worst of Evil</h3>
<p>Nice plot that is something realistic.</p>
